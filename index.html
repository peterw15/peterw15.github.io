            Hello! I'm Peter Wright, a 20 year old <b>BSc Computer Science</b>
            student currently studying my second year at the <b>University of Kent</b> in Canterbury. </br>
            Computer Science is a subject I have always been enthusiastic towards and I have taken up many hobbies and interests because of it. It is also what I aspire to get a career in.  </br>
            This website will provide you with information about both myself and coding projects I have worked on. </br></br>

        <u class="subHeading" style="text-align: left">Interests</u></br>
            So far both education and personal interest have helped me experience different programming paradigms and languages such as Object Oriented (<b>Java/C#</b>), </br>
            Functional (<b>Haskell</b>).I have also developed skills specialising in Web Development (<b>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</b>) which I have used to develop this website. <br>
            Outside of education I have developed skills in applications such as Unity for Game Development, Arduino (<b>C/C++</b>) for creating Raspberry Pi Applications and devices <br>
            As well as Adobe Applications applications such as Photoshop for Graphic Design and Premiere Pro for Video Editing.
